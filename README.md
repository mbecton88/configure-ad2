# Lab: Building Your Own Azure Active Directory Domain

**Objective:**
Create a domain controller, join a client machine, and configure security policies to simulate a real-world network environment with security best practices.

**Why?**
We need to create a domain controller, join a client machine, and configure security policies to simulate a real-world network environment with security best practices.

## 5. Join Client-1 to the Domain

* **Action:** Ensure "Client-1's" DNS settings point to "DC-1's" private IP address (from previous lab).
* **Action:** Restart "Client-1" from the Azure portal.
* **Action:** Log in to "Client-1" as the local "labuser."
* **Action:** Open "System Properties" -> "Computer Name" -> "Change."
* **Action:** Select "Domain" and enter "mydomain.com."
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e54f42b-1800-4a72-bfa9-2743903c6027)
* **Action:** Enter "mydomain.com\jane_admin" and "Cyberlab123!" when prompted.
* **Action:** Restart "Client-1."
* **Action:** Log in to "DC-1" and verify "Client-1" is in ADUC.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a7d2212-0e5c-497e-8210-f6940bdb2d60)
* **Action:** Create an OU named "_CLIENTS" and move "Client-1" into it.
* **Explanation:** This joins the client machine to the domain.

## 6. Enable Remote Desktop for Domain Users

* **Action:** Log in to "Client-1" as "mydomain.com\jane_admin."
* **Action:** Open "System Properties" -> "Remote Desktop."
* **Action:** Select "Allow remote connections to this computer."
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd685ef9-7f16-4737-beab-6ee34837c7e4)
* **Action:** Click "Select Users" and add "Domain Users."
* **Explanation:** This allows domain users to remotely access the client machine.


---

## 7. Create Multiple Users

* **Action:** Log in to "DC-1" as "mydomain.com\jane_admin."
* **Action:** Open "PowerShell ISE" as administrator.
* **Action:** Create a new file and paste the following script:

    ```powershell
    for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
        $username = "user$i"
        $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Cyberlab123!" -AsPlainText -Force
        New-ADUser -Name $username -SamAccountName $username -UserPrincipalName "$username@cyberlab.com" -AccountPassword $password -Enabled $true -Path "OU=_EMPLOYEES,DC=cyberlab,DC=com"
    }
    ```

* **Action:** Run the script.
* **Action:** Open ADUC and verify the new users are in the "_EMPLOYEES" OU.
* **Action:** Attempt to log in to "Client-1" as one of the new users (e.g., "cyberlab.com\user1").
* **Explanation:** This script creates five new users in the "_EMPLOYEES" OU. This tests remote access for a standard user.
* **Screenshot Hint:** Capture a screenshot of ADUC showing the newly created users and a screenshot of the login screen to client one with one of the new users attempting to log in.

## Finish Up

* Do not delete the VMs.
* "Stop" or "Deallocate" VMs to save costs.
